Welcome!

### Getting started

- Clone or fork the repo
- Add a **.env** file, make a [Supabase account](https://supabase.com/), add a database, and add its key following **.sample-env**.
- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn dev` to run the app at **localhost:3000/**

That's it. Changes to components should hot-reload in the browser.
